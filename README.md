# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System using TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity

This is a content-based movie recommendation system built using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The system suggests similar movies based on the userâ€™s favorite movie input by analyzing text features like genre, keywords, tagline, cast, and director.



## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This system helps users discover movies similar to their preferences using a content-based approach. It relies on textual information of the movies, converts it into numeric form using **TF-IDF vectorization**, and measures similarity using **cosine similarity**.



## ðŸš€ Features

- Input your favorite movie and get a list of recommended movies.
- Uses combined features like genre, keywords, tagline, cast, and director.
- Employs **TF-IDF Vectorizer** for text feature extraction.
- Uses **Cosine Similarity** for finding similar movies.
- Based on a real-world dataset from YBI Foundation.



## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Difflib
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Cosine Similarity



## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used for this project was sourced from [YBI Foundation](https://github.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset) and includes metadata of various movies.



## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Load and clean the dataset.
2. Merge selected text-based features into a single string.
3. Vectorize text using **TF-IDF**.
4. Compute similarity scores using **Cosine Similarity**.
5. Match user input with closest movie title using `difflib`.
6. Recommend top 10â€“30 similar movies based on similarity score.



## ðŸ“¥ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunal-10-02/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
